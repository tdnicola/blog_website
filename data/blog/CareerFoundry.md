I often receive inquiries about my coding bootcamp experience on LinkedIn. It's a topic that truly intrigues me, and I'm always delighted when people seek advice on this path. I believe it's a great way to get some feedback from those who have already navigated this journey. I did the same, and I wholeheartedly recommend it. I started CareerFoundry in Jan 2019 and completed it at the end of 2019.

Before enrolling in [CareerFoundry](https://careerfoundry.com/), I dabbled in coding through free resources like [CodeAcdemy](https://www.codecademy.com/) and took several courses on Coursera. While I had a basic understanding of concepts like CSS improving HTML's aesthetics, my coding skills were at a beginner's level. What kept me going was the sheer fun I found in coding.

When it came to choosing between in-person and online learning, I was torn. Living in Denver, the only coding bootcamp was downtown, a 45-minute commute from my location. Online learning offered more flexibility, allowing me to progress at my own pace, adapting to my life outside of coding. This work-life balance was a significant advantage. I couldn't imagine giving up my job to attend an in-person bootcamp, and I wonder how many can afford to do so. Reflecting on my experience, I'm curious whether online learning was more of a detriment or a benefit for me.

CareerFoundry assigns both a mentor and a tutor. The mentor provided guidance on higher-level concepts and career paths, while the tutor was more involved, grading projects and assisting with questions.

Ideally, you'd stick with the same mentor and tutor throughout the program. Personally, I had 2-3 mentors and 3-4 tutors, which could be somewhat frustrating. With each new mentor or tutor, you needed to reintroduce yourself and explain your previous projects. It wasn't a major inconvenience, but it's part of the experience.

My last mentor, whom I had for about half of the program, was a fantastic fit. He offered invaluable advice, and our conversations were insightful. To this day, we still maintain contact, which speaks to the quality of the relationship.

Now, let's talk about the program itself. Online learning can be challenging because there's no external pressure to attend classes or show up onsite. Personally, I'm cheap, so the investment I made in the course was motivation enough to stay committed. However, there were days when exhaustion set in, and I'd lose the motivation to study. Over time, if my cheapness hadn't been there I can see where instances could lead to weeks without touching a line of code.

As for the program's content, I don't have any major complaints. The abundance of options can feel overwhelming, so having a dedicated curriculum was reassuring. My focus was on front-end development, and there are various learning paths to explore.  Coding is inherently challenging. You'll have moments where you feel like you're banging your head against the wall, but there will also be times when you experience the satisfaction of solving complex problems. 

While I enjoyed the program, I realized that I didn't have as much of an eye for aesthetics (front end) as I initially thought. My satisfaction came from functionality rather than visual appeal. This realization might have discouraged some, but my cheapness to complete the program pushed me forward.

The primary takeaway from this program for me was "learning to code." That might sound unusual, but learning itself is a skill. It involves reading documentation, troubleshooting, and structuring projectsâ€”skills that are universal across coding languages. CareerFoundry played a significant role in helping me develop and appreciate these skills.

In the end, I didn't venture directly into web development, but the program greatly enhanced my coding abilities and my love for learning to code. After CareerFoundry, I delved into Python, which ultimately led to my previous position at Equiscript. From there, I continued building on my skills with SQL, python, and using SSMS/SSIS.

So, my experience with CareerFoundry was a mix of enjoyment and challenges. While I didn't find web development as appealing as I had initially hoped, I discovered a passion for coding and the art of learning itself, all thanks to the foundations laid by CareerFoundry.
