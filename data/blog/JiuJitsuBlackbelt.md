# My Timeline Through Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu:

My path led me to the world of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) in 2011. Along the way, I've faced challenges, changes, and even burnout, but I've also experienced immense personal growth. Here's a timeline of my journey from white to black belt.

- **Started BJJ:** 2011
- **Blue Belt:** 2013 (?)
- **Purple Belt:** 2015 (?)
- **Brown Belt:** August 2016
- **Black Belt:** August 2023

## First Exposure (2003)

My first encounter with the world of combat sports happened in high school back in 2003. During an away soccer game, my Coach Ian Hasagawa introduced our team to the original UFC on the bus ride. I couldn't help but wonder if we were preparing for a fight or a soccer match.

Around 2008, my interest in BJJ grew. I'd heard a lot about it and wanted to give it a try. However, my local town didn't have any BJJ instructors at the time. I remember my cousin saying "Hey I know this guy who teaches BJJ." This lead to learning from a random guy in his basement arond 2010. The catch was that it was a 45-minute drive to get there. But it was a start. He would let me train once a week. On the off days I would "train" with my cousin in the grass.. It was crazy.

## Organized Classes in Pueblo (2010)

A breakthrough came when a small group opened up in Pueblo, Colorado, inside a karate school. It was my first taste of "organized" BJJ classes. I joined a bunch of newbie white belts. But they knew more than I did. They were an affiliate school with Sidney Silva. Who would come out for seminars a few times a year. I started competing in Fight 2 Win tournaments during this time. The group of people I started with still train. They've opened up their own schools and are now Black belts. Childress BJJ in Pueblo, CO.

## Denver: From White to Brown Belt

Moving to Denver marked a significant turning point for my BJJ. Initially, I didn't even have a car, so I commuted by bike. I was staying with some friends in Aurora while I had a job in Highlands ranch. I'd ride 25 miles to work one way, stop by Easton BJJ on my way home, do two classes, and then repeat the process. Eventually, I moved closer to the school and my job, making it easier to train. Since I was at the gym so much they asked if I would be interesting in cleaning the mats at night.


## The Blue Belt Obsession

As a new blue belt, and like all blue belts that don't disappear, I was obsessed with BJJ Living near the school and having a flexible schedule allowed me to attend 10ish classes a week, fueling my passion for the sport. The Easton school I was at was big enough to have 10-20 people in each class, which was awesome. I was training under Vellore Caballero and Ethan Snow.

## Purple Belt Flexibility

At purple belt, I changed positions at work, giving me a more flexible schedule. I started attending multiple competition classes during my lunch on weekdays, where top-level competitors from neighboring schools gathered. I even scheduled everything around these classes, making BJJ a central part of my life. I think back on this time really fondly: A flexible job that I didn't hate, Living and working close to home and my bjj gym, the physical ability to push really hard and bounce back, and the time to be able to spend doing it all.

## Life Transitions

After reaching brown belt in 2016, My contract position ended. My partner and I wanted a bit of a change and moved to South Carolina, where through sheer luck the local Checkmat Charleston was going through a transition and I was able to step in as general manager. That humidity and BJJ is next level... I hated it. I got to train under and with LÃ©o Vieira.

## Return to Colorado and Teaching

After about a year we returned to Colorado, I worked at a corperate banking center and resumed training at Easton BJJ. A teaching position opened up at the school, and I embraced it, teaching and training full-time for over a year. It was great. And here is the start of the downfall... I never really did find out what was going on... I had some medical issues pop up that caused me to constantly have to go to the doctor. I was constantly having trouble. And anyone who knows teaching BJJ and having money don't mix well. I eventually became way to stressed about appointments, money, and burnout eventually forced me to step away from teaching and training.

I transitioned back to a regular job for health insurance and stopped training as competitively until I could recover fully. I attended classes about three times a week but still grappled with feelings of burnout and stress.

## Parenthood and Relocation

The journey continued as my partner and I found out we were expecting a child. We decided to move to South Carolina to be closer to her family for support. However, the nearest BJJ school was about 45 miles away. I attended open mats on weekends until COVID-19 temporarily closed down that school.

I secured a remote position and moved to Greenville, South Carolina, where I trained at Alliance Greenville for a few months.

## Settling in Vancouver, WA

Recently we moved to Vancouver, Washington, where I joined Inertia BJJ under Professor Justin Bendsneyder. Balancing training with a toddler proved challenging, and I still grappled with burnout. However, Professor Justin's approach was all about "How do we get you back to enjoying BJJ". 

On August 5 2023 I received my black belt from Professor Justin. It was a fun time.

I think about BJJ a lot still. Though now, I'm lucky to get in and train once a week. I enjoy being a father with my son. BJJ has shifted down in my priorities due to life changes, and I'm okay with that. I look forward to sharing it with my son when he's old enough.

There are a few things that BJJ has taught me, These are universal to all things not just BJJ:
-    *   Stick with it and you will get better.
-    *   Put in more time and you will get better.
