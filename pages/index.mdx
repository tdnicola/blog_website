# Tony Nicola

Hello There!
I am a Data Analyst that is having fun learning to automate things.

Webdev boot camp grad turned Data Analyst. It took me a whole bootcamp to learn maybe I didn't like web development as I thought I would. I spent way too much time trying to center overlapping images (like this site hint hint)... But I really enjoyed coding. A conundrum...

How can I still code and make my job more efficient? a win win? I quickly grew to enjoy coding in Python for it's versatility and vast ability to automate tasks.

I'm using this website as a way to keep track and explain problems I've encountered or am having. If you have any questions on any of these projects I'd love to chat about it.

In addition to programming, I enjoy practicing Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, pc gaming, and experimenting with home automation.
